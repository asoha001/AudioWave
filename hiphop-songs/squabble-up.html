            <p data-time="2">I am</p>
            <p data-time="4">Reincarnated, I was stargazin'</p>
            <p data-time="8">Life goes on, I need all my babies (gyah, gyah)</p>
            <p data-time="12">Woke up lookin' for the broccoli</p>
            <p data-time="16">High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi</p>
            <p data-time="20">IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me</p>
            <p data-time="24">Mr. Get Off, I get off at my feet</p>
            <p data-time="28">(When I hear music, it makes me dance)</p>
            <p data-time="32">(You got the music, now is your chance)</p>
            <p data-time="36">A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state</p>
            <p data-time="40">Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated</p>
            <p data-time="44">Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated</p>
            <p data-time="48">I got the money and the power both gyratin'</p>
            <p data-time="52">I feel good, get the fuck out my face</p>
            <p data-time="56">Look good, but she don't got no taste</p>
            <p data-time="60">I walk in, walked out with the safe</p>
            <p data-time="64">Mando, let me know what the play</p>
            <p data-time="68">What the fuck? I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts</p>
            <p data-time="72">I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks</p>
            <p data-time="76">Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe</p>
            <p data-time="80">Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough</p>
            <p data-time="84">Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up</p>
            <p data-time="88">Fallin' from my money tree and it grow throughout the months</p>
