            <p data-time="4">They're complaining, over-educated</p>
            <p data-time="8">You are saying all the words I'm dreaming</p>
            <p data-time="12">Say it after me</p>
            <p data-time="16">Say it after me</p>
            <p data-time="20">They will blame us, crucify, and shame us</p>
            <p data-time="24">We can't help it, if we are a problem</p>
            <p data-time="28">We are trying hard to get your attention</p>
            <p data-time="32">I'm climbing up your wall</p>
            <p data-time="36">Climbing up your wall</p>
            <p data-time="40">Don't go there, 'cause you'll never return</p>
            <p data-time="44">I know you think of me, when you think of her</p>
            <p data-time="48">But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard</p>
            <p data-time="52">To do the right thing but without recompense</p>
            <p data-time="56">And then you did something wrong and you said it was great</p>
            <p data-time="60">And now you don't know how you could ever complain</p>
            <p data-time="64">Because you're all confused, 'cause you want me to</p>
            <p data-time="68">But then you want me to do it the same as you</p>
            <p data-time="72">You were waiting for the elevator</p>
            <p data-time="76">You were saying, all the words I'm dreaming</p>
            <p data-time="80">No more asking, questions or excuses</p>
            <p data-time="84">The information's here, here and everywhere</p>

            <p data-time="176">Here we go friends (Hold on, I can't)</p>
            <p data-time="180">Maybe that's a kooky situation</p>
